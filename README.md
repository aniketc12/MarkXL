# MarkXL

MarkXL allows you to enter marks easily in Excel Documents. Just enter the search field cell numbers, and the program
will search for students with names/numbers in that field using just the first few alphabets for the name or the first
few digits for the student number. If there is more than one student who's information starts with the same identifier then
all of those students will be displayed for you to choose from while entering marks.
This elimantes the need to contantly have to search for a student every time and manually enter the mark so that entering 
marks can be a little easier.
